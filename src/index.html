    <!-- 
         React will render everything in here. container/App.js is the origin point of where to start with your ReactJS app.
         server/server.js is the express file for the backend. webpack and babel are only configured for react and ES6 to ES5
        
         This boilerplate is only made to have a very basic React app from the start. Most ReactJS boilerplates create code which is filled with features
         some might not want. Since I just found boilerplates with some additional features, i wanted to create a really basic MERN Stack boilerplate
         on which some could build greater apps upon.
